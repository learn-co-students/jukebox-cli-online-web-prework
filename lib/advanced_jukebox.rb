# I had a working method going above, but Beth showed me a solid method
# chaining that I had tried in the past and then the way cool
# .with_index() method instead of index + 1 to allow for numbering the list
# without starting with zero as the first index of the array. 
# .keys created the array of keys that we used .with_index() on. 
# So .keys creates array of the keys from my_songs hash, then we iterate 
# over each (.each) element (key) in the array calling .with_index(1) on
# each element index (chaining the methods) then we puts the value of 
# that changed/iterated
# index with a period - 1. and the value of the name_key for that iteration, 
# creating a numbered list of songs to choose from as it loops and iterates
# through the array of keys(name_key).
    
  #this method is different! Collect the keys of the my_songs hash and 
  #list the songs by name
